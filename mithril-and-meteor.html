							<h2 id="mithril-and-meteor">Mithril and Meteor</h2>
<p>Some people have asked me how one could go about integrating Mithril with Meteor.</p>
<p>For those who don&#39;t know, Meteor is a NodeJS framework that allows developers to write code that can be reused in the server and in the client. Some of its other selling points include a live reload feature, and a unified API for dealing with data persistence.</p>
<p>In this article, we&#39;ll look at replacing Meteor&#39;s built-in templating engine, Blaze w/ Mithril&#39;s, and in the process, we&#39;ll hopefully demistify some of the magic in Meteor.</p>
<p>To install Meteor, follow <a href="http://docs.meteor.com/#quickstart">these instructions</a>. If you&#39;re on Windows, there&#39;s an <a href="http://win.meteor.com/">unofficial installer here</a>. Once you&#39;ve installed it, let&#39;s start a new project. Open up your terminal and type:</p>
<pre><code>meteor create leaderboard
cd leaderboard
meteor run
</code></pre><p>The first line creates a blank application in a folder called <code>leaderboard</code>. The last line starts the Meteor&#39;s built-in server at the URL <code>http://localhost:3000</code></p>
<p>In this article, we&#39;ll build a simple version of the Leaderboard app. Leaderboard is the &quot;hello world&quot; of Meteor. It shows a list of users and their respective scores, and it allows us to select a user by clicking on their name, and then give them points by hitting a button at the bottom. An example implementation can be <a href="http://leaderboard.meteor.com/">found here</a>.</p>
<p>An important thing to notice that is not obvious at first is that this app updates in real time. To see what I mean, open the app in two different windows side-by-side, and give some points to one of the players. You&#39;ll see the score for that player update on both pages, without needing to refresh either page. This gives us an important clue about how Meteor works, and we&#39;ll explore that in a bit.</p>
<p>But first things first. Let&#39;s create a <em>collection</em> to store data. Meteor uses MongoDB as its database system and in Meteor/MongoDB lingo, a collection is roughly equivalent to a table from SQL databases. Some major differences between MongoDB and SQL databases, however, are that MongoDB collections don&#39;t necessarily need to have a schema and that items in the collection can have deeply nested fields (think a JSON document).</p>
<p>Anyways. Fire up your browser and go to <code>http://localhost:3000</code>, and type these commands in your developer tools console.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">var PlayerList = new Meteor.Collection(&quot;players&quot;)
PlayerList.insert({name: &quot;John&quot;, score: 0})
PlayerList.insert({name: &quot;Bob&quot;, score: 0})
PlayerList.insert({name: &quot;Mary&quot;, score: 0})
</code></pre>
<p>Hopefully, those commands should be self-explanatory: we created a collection called <code>players</code> and populated it with 3 entries. What might not be so obvious, though, is that these entries have been saved to the database on our server. Obviously, in a real application, being able to arbitrarily write to the database from the browser command-line is a big no-no, and Meteor does let us lock down this ability.</p>
<p>We can also query the collection to ensure our data is really there. Type this in the browser&#39;s console:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">PlayerList.find().fetch()
</code></pre>
<p>You should see our three players, and each should have an <code>_id</code> field generated by the database, in addition to the <code>name</code> and <code>score</code> fields that we defined.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now that we have some test data to work with, let&#39;s start building our application. First delete the <code>leaderboard.html</code>, <code>leaderboard.css</code> and <code>leaderboard.js</code> files. These initial files just contain a simple hello world app, which is not relevant to this article.</p>
<p>Put a copy of the mithril.js file in this folder, and create a new blank file called <code>leaderboard.js</code>.</p>
<p>The first thing we&#39;ll do is create a helper function to integrate Mithril to Meteor. As you saw in the working example application, Meteor updates data on screen in real time. This is possible thanks to web sockets, a technology that allows us to push data from the server to the client without clients initiating AJAX requests. Clients can then listen to <em>reactive data sources</em>, which are at their core, event handlers that fire whenever new data is available from a web socket data push.</p>
<p>The simplest way to integrate to Meteor&#39;s reactive data sources is to use its <a href="http://docs.meteor.com/#deps"><code>Deps</code></a> micro-library. Specifically, <code>Deps.autorun</code> is exactly what we need: it runs an arbitrary function any time there&#39;s new data, and returns a handle to an object that allows us to stop calling this arbitrary function (for example, if a route changes, we don&#39;t want to keep firing things related to the old page).</p>
<p>Let&#39;s see what this looks like in code. First we&#39;ll implement a <em>controller transformer</em>. Much like template transformers, a controller transformer simply takes a controller function as an argument and returns another controller function. We&#39;ll be using this technique as a trick to emulate class inheritance for dynamically-scoped controllers (recall that <a href="prototypes-closures-and-the-zen-of-javascript-oop.html">Javascript does not natively support class-based OOP</a>).</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">var reactive = function(controller) {
    return function() {
        var instance = {}

        controller.call(instance)

        return instance
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The code above <code>call</code>s one controller&#39;s constructor function with a blank object as it&#39;s target, which makes the <code>this</code> keyword inside <code>controller</code> point to the <code>instance</code> object. This effectively copies any members of <code>controller</code> onto the <code>instance</code> object, so in the end, this instance has the same public members as if we called <code>new controller</code>. We can now freely augment the <code>instance</code> object, without necessarily knowing anything about the code inside the <code>controller</code> function.</p>
<p>So let&#39;s go ahead and hook up <code>Deps.autorun</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">var reactive = function(controller) {
    return function() {
        var instance = {}

        var computation = Deps.autorun(function() {
            m.startComputation()
            controller.call(instance)
            m.endComputation()
        })

        instance.onunload = function() {
            computation.stop()
        }

        return instance
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that we wrapped <code>controller.call(instance)</code> in a <code>m.startComputation</code> / <code>m.endComputation</code> context. This is important. What&#39;s happening here is that calling <code>Deps.autorun</code> registers a new callback which will run whenever new data is available. Since this callback runs asynchronously, then any time it fires, we need to tell Mithril that things are ready to be redrawn.</p>
<p>As we saw earlier, calling <code>controller.call(instance)</code> copies data over to our <code>instance</code>. So, calling it repeatedly every time new data is available essentially makes <code>instance</code> update all its public data, and this updated data is then consumed by the view when Mithril&#39;s redrawing system kicks in.</p>
<p>The other thing to notice is that we defined an <code>onunload</code> handler. This is a Mithril handler that fires for modules when a route changes. While this handler will not be used for this article&#39;s example, it&#39;s important to be aware that subscriptions to reactive data sources have a lifecycle that needs to be managed. As I mentioned earlier, <code>Deps.autorun</code> returns a handle that can be used to stop firing the callback. So if a route changes in a Mithril app, <code>onunload</code> fires, which in turn, calls <code>computation.stop()</code>. Once that is called, new data from the server will no longer trigger the callback that contains our <code>controller.call(instance)</code> call. If we didn&#39;t define this <code>onunload</code> handler, our callback would keep firing forever even after the controller is no longer being used by the application due to a route change.</p>
<p>Note that I&#39;m forcefully assigning a callback to onunload here for the sake of keeping the code easy to understand, but in real life, this code would need to ensure that we don&#39;t clobber previously defined onunload handlers. </p>
<hr>
<p>Ok, now that we have a bit of appreciation for what the magic in Meteor is all about, we can finally start building the application.</p>
<p>First, let&#39;s make the <code>players</code> collection available. Put this in the <code>leaderboard.js</code> file:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">//model

//Meteor collection of players
var PlayerList = new Meteor.Collection(&quot;players&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Next, let&#39;s create a View Model entity which will hold functions to express the things that we want to be able to do with our <code>players</code> data (i.e. get a list of players, select a player, ask whether a given player is selected, and give points to a selected player).</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">//Leaderboard view model
var Leaderboard = {}

//selected player
Leaderboard.selectedPlayerID = null

//application actions
Leaderboard.players = function() {
    return PlayerList.find().fetch()
}
Leaderboard.select = function(player) {
    Leaderboard.selectedPlayerID = player._id
}
Leaderboard.selected = function(player) {
    return Leaderboard.selectedPlayerID == player._id
}
Leaderboard.givePoints = function() {
    if (Leaderboard.selectedPlayerID) {
        PlayerList.update({_id: Leaderboard.selectedPlayerID}, {$inc: {score: 5}})
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that <code>Leaderboard.players</code> uses the same code for retrieving a list of players, as we saw earlier.</p>
<p>The <code>Leaderboard.givePoints</code> function calls <code>PlayerList.update</code>. The first argument is a &quot;where&quot; clause, and the second argument is the action to perform. So this code updates a player whose <code>_id</code> matches the selected player&#39;s <code>_id</code>, and increments their score by 5. <code>$inc</code> is one of the many modifiers that can be used to define actions to be performed on Meteor collections. A complete list of modifiers can be found on the <a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operator/update/">MongoDB docs</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Next, let&#39;s create our controller:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">//controller
Leaderboard.controller = reactive(function() {
    this.players = Leaderboard.players()
})
</code></pre>
<p>All we&#39;re doing here is specifying the scope of the data which we&#39;re going to be work with. In our case, we&#39;re just grabbing the whole list of players.</p>
<p>Notice that all the state management code is in the model layer, and that our controller does almost nothing. This is a good example of the lean controller philosophy that <a href="put-your-controllers-on-a-diet.html">I talked about in another article</a>.</p>
<p>The key thing to notice in the snippet above is that we finally used the <code>reactive</code> helper function we created earlier. If you recall, <code>reactive</code> makes a controller constructor re-run every time new data is available from the server. So in our case, we call <code>Leaderboard.players()</code> every time new data arrives. It then calls <code>PlayerList.find().fetch()</code>. And here is where we can see the beauty of Meteor in action: <code>PlayerList.find()</code> does not actually make another round-trip request to the server at this point. Remember that this entire function is only running because Meteor signaled via <code>Deps.autorun</code> that new data is available. What it also did under the hood is sync said data to its internal client-side cache, so calling <code>PlayerList.find</code> within a <code>Deps.autorun</code> context is as cheap as looking for the data in a Javascript object. And because the data is already there, <code>.fetch()</code> can return the data synchronously.</p>
<p>If you understand the benefits of Mithril templates being declarative re-runnable entities, you should see how the Meteor data flow system fits like a glove: our module can now always run from top to bottom, and the state of the application is completely decoupled and always synced everywhere. This makes it <em>extremely easy</em> to reason about application state.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now that our reactive controller is setup, let&#39;s create a simple template to actually see things on screen:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">//view
Leaderboard.view = function(ctrl) {
    return [
        m(&quot;ul&quot;, [
            ctrl.players.map(function(player) {
                return m(&quot;li&quot;, {
                    style: {background: Leaderboard.selected(player) ? &quot;yellow&quot; : &quot;&quot;},
                    onclick: Leaderboard.select.bind(this, player)
                }, player.name + &quot;: &quot; + player.score)
            })
        ]),
        m(&quot;button&quot;, {onclick: Leaderboard.givePoints}, &quot;Give 5 points&quot;)
    ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>Nothing fancy there, just a list of players and their scores. Clicking on a player selects and highlights them, and clicking on the button on the bottom gives points to the selected player. </p>
<p>We just need a last snippet to initialize our app as a Mithril module:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">//render the app
if (Meteor.isClient) {
    Meteor.startup(function() {
        m.module(document, Leaderboard)
    })
}
</code></pre>
<p>And we&#39;re done!</p>
<hr>
<p>Here&#39;s the full code:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">//meteor helper
var reactive = function(controller) {
    return function() {
        var instance = {}

        var computation = Deps.autorun(function() {
            m.startComputation()
            controller.call(instance)
            m.endComputation()
        })

        instance.onunload = function() {
            computation.stop()
        }

        return instance
    }
}

//model

//Meteor collection of players
var PlayerList = new Meteor.Collection(&quot;players&quot;)

//Leaderboard view model
//Leaderboard view model
var Leaderboard = {}

//selected player

}

    Leaderboard.selectedPlayerID = player._id
}

    return Leaderboard.selectedPlayerID == player._id
}
Leaderboard.givePoints = function() {
    if (Leaderboard.selectedPlayerID) {
        PlayerList.update({_id: Leaderboard.selectedPlayerID}, {$inc: {score: 5}})
    }
}

    this.players = Leaderboard.players()
})

    return [
        m(&quot;ul&quot;, [
            ctrl.players.map(function(player) {
                return m(&quot;li&quot;, {
                    style: {background: Leaderboard.selected(player) ? &quot;yellow&quot; : &quot;&quot;},
                    onclick: Leaderboard.select.bind(this, player)
                }, player.name + &quot;: &quot; + player.score)
            })
        ]),
        m(&quot;button&quot;, {onclick: Leaderboard.givePoints}, &quot;Give 5 points&quot;)
    ]
}

//render the app

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>The <code>reactive</code> helper changes the semantics of controllers in such a way that forces state to be in the model layer, and allows us to think of controllers as declarative entities, much like we already do with Mithril templates. In addition, the automatic data syncing provided by Meteor greatly simplifies the complexity of application state itself: if you are using a Meteor collection, then you can be sure the data on the database is what you see on screen (and vice versa).</p>
<p>Conversely, Mithril <a href="when-css-lets-you-down.html">brings</a> <a href="asymmetrical-data-bindings.html">the</a> <a href="better-templates-with-fp.html">power</a> and <a href="http://lhorie.github.io/todomvc-perf-comparison/todomvc-benchmark">the</a> <a href="http://lhorie.github.io/mithril/benchmarks.html">performance</a> of its templating engine to the world of Meteor.</p>
<p>There&#39;s obviously a lot more to Meteor than what I covered here, and I encourage you to try implementing one of the <a href="https://www.meteor.com/examples/parties">other</a> <a href="https://www.meteor.com/examples/todos">example</a> <a href="https://www.meteor.com/examples/wordplay">apps</a> if Meteor looks interesting to you.</p>
<p>Also, if anyone is using Mithril and Meteor together, please post below. I&#39;d love to hear about it!</p>
